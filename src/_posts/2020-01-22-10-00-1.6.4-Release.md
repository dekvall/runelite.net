description: 'Aggregated loot data, Clan member recoloring'
author: dekvall

The Loot Tracker plugin has been reworked to retain your loot for longer and will load a greater amount of loot data when starting the client. This will make it easier to track your progression when going for those very rare drops.

The Clan Chat plugin now has the ability to recolor players that also are on your ignore list.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Add Brimhaven cart traveling to menu entry swapper
- Add Chambers of Xeric personal best tracking to chat commands
- Forcibly bring client to front when requesting focus on Windows
- Use wiki scraped NPCs for NPC healths

Enjoy!
